# SpicetifyThemes-Web
This was a project I was working on to apply spicetify themes to the web player 

This is Semi-Functional but has lots of issues
If you wish to use this:

- Run `GetSpiceClasses.js` on the desktop Client
- Copy the output object
- Create a Variable on the web Client with the object from the Desktop client as the value
- Run `CreateCSSMap.js` on the Web Client
- Run `CreateCSSMap([Varible Name You Made])`
- Copy the object and paste it into the cssMap varble in `Create Spicetify Button.js` 
- Run `Create Spicetify Button.js` on the web client
